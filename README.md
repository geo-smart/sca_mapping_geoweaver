# Snow Cover Analysis (SCA) Mapping

This project aims to use advanced machine learning techniques to predict and analyze snow cover using satellite images. Whether you're a researcher, a nature enthusiast, or simply curious about how technology can help us understand our environment, this project provides a fascinating insight into snow cover analysis.

## Project Overview

### What is Snow Cover Analysis?

Snow cover analysis involves studying the extent and distribution of snow on the ground. This information is crucial for understanding climate patterns, managing water resources, and assessing environmental changes. Satellite images provide a powerful tool for observing snow cover over large areas.

### Project Goals

1. **Predict Snow Cover**: Use satellite images to predict areas covered by snow.
2. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
3. **Visualize Snow Cover**: Create visual representations of snow cover for easy understanding and analysis.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Data Preparation

We start by gathering and preparing the necessary data. This involves:

- **Collecting Satellite Images**: High-resolution images from Planet satellites.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting the data for analysis.

### Step 2: Model Training

Using advanced machine learning techniques, we train a model to predict snow cover. The model learns to recognize patterns in the satellite images that indicate the presence of snow.

### Step 3: Snow Cover Prediction

Once the model is trained, it can predict snow cover on new satellite images. This helps in real-time monitoring of snow-covered areas.

### Step 4: Model Evaluation

To ensure our predictions are accurate, we evaluate the model using various metrics. This step is crucial for understanding the reliability of our predictions and making necessary improvements.

### Step 5: Visualization

Finally, we create visual representations of the snow cover predictions. These visuals make it easy to see the distribution and extent of snow-covered areas.
